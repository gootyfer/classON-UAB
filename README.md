To access to an example of the student version go to
http://localhost:3000/student/p1/
You will be asked to log in with the student id (or ids if working in pairs) and the position in the classroom.

Before being able to log in, you must populate the database with users. For that, you may use the utility to import users from CSV at `users/saveUsersFromCSV`.

- `CSVfilname` is the path to the CSV file with the users data
- `groupName` is the name give to these group of users (usually their class)


If you want to use classON with your own assignment, you can use the classON author tool but it's *still unfinished*:
